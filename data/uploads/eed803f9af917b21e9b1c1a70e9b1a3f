I guess they're forced to sit down and join the group for dinner. Bill Gates Sr. asked this odd guest group assembled there, what <b>factor</b> does everybody think has been <b>most important</b> in achieving where you've gotten in life? And there were people at this table who've gotten very far in life. Bill and Warren, both immediately reply with one word, which is <b><i>focus</i></b>.</p>
